| Published in ?                | November 25, 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| General topic ?               | A team of researchers developed a new targeted therapy against an abnormal protein produced by cancer cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Procedure/what was examined ? | Researchers studied the protein TCF3-HLF and the proteins bound to it using the CRISPR/CAS9 method. They have also developped a new substance that kills leukemic cells by administering to mice transplanted with human leukemic cells.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Conclusions/discovery ?       | Scientists have discovered that the abnormal protein TCF3-HLF binds more than hundred proteins and activates hundreds of genes by mistake. They identified 11 of these proteins that are implicated in the development of leukemia. Researchers have developed a new substance called A-485 that binds and inhibits the protein EP300. The administration of A-485 to mice killed the leukemic cells |
| Remaining questions ?         | Scientists are continuing their research to develop the best treatment. Other forms of leukemia are caused by similar mechanisms, their work could help identify a common target for anti-cancer treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
